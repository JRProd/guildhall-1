## Assignments
Assignments will be due at the end of your Lab Section each week starting the week of the 28th. 

**ICC**: In Class Checked:  Most assignments will be graded visually, with a compnent of the grade being attributed to the project being checked in compilable state on Git with no warnings. 

**CRS & CRC**:  Code Review Start and Code Review Check.  Two additional grades for code reviews will happen throughout the semester.  CRS is the date in which I will start the code review and get you feedback within a week.  You will then have a week to apply whatever changes were requested (if needed), due by the CRC date.
