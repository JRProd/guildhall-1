## Rubric

### Required Tasks
**Required Tasks** are tasks that the course relies on being complete, and will most likely be built upon on later assignments.  All required tasks must be attempted before a bonus task will be graded. 

- [ ] `WindowContext` class
  - [ ] Ensure your configuration blackboard works
  - [ ] 
- [ ] `RenderContext` changes
- [ ] Cycling Color Clear Screen
    - [ ] `SwapChain` correctly fixed.

### Bonus Tasks
**Bonus Tasks** are tasks that are related to the main assignment, but are not required for finishing the course, hopefully to allow for some personalization of your own engine.

No required tasks will build off bonus tasks, but future bonus tasks may (and they will clearly label which ones they require). 

These tasks *may be completed for any assignment in this semester*, but you must clearly state which extras you are turning in for which assignment.  You may resubmit an extra on multiple assignments to make up lost points.

Example, say for the `DevConsole` assignment, you attempt the extra `auto-complete`, worth 8 points. While testing, I notice that it crashes if backspace is pressed midway through an autocompleted command, but otherwise works.  You are awarded say 5/8 for that extra.  You may then fix that bug, resubmit, and get the remaining 3/8 on a later assignment.  After that though no more points may be acquired from that extra.  

Note, most bonus tasks are twice the work for half the points of a required task, and will not be graded at all if not all required tasks are attempted.  

- [ ] (X01.00) Fullscreen Support.  This is not the automatic support DX11 adds by default
- [ ] (X01.01) Borderless Window Support
- [ ] (X01.02) Window Alignment Options
