## Overview
Going over fundamental 2D and 3D math commonly used in game developement.

We'll be spending the first third of the class creating a basic 2D physics engine, testing by making a Pachinko game. 

After that, we'll move over to 3D math in support of the RTS project in SD2.

## Hopeful Topics
A list of topics I hope to cover in the above weeks as we go over the above systems, and depending what falls out of the project.  If we ever have a lull for topics, we can pull from this list as well. 

- Flow/Vector Fields
- HexGrid
- Quaternions
